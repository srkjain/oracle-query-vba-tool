Oracle Query VBA Tool (OQVT) is Microsoft Excel (VBA) based solution to fetch data from oracle database. It allows fetching data from multiple schemas (users) of same or different oracle database.

Key Benefits are

1) Write sql queries once and execute any time. No need to write same query again and again.
2) Easier for non-technical user to get the data from database without knowing underlying tables or sql syntax
3) Categorized the multiple queries to run all at once
4) Gets data from multiple schemas (users). For example it can fetch some parameter value from the production and all test environment in single click without requiring user to connect to each environment
5) Queries can be parametrized to get the input at run time. (For example, Query can ask user to input the client number which will in used in where clause to get only client related information)
6) Data will be fetch in Excel sheet so you can use all excel feature to filter and see the information.
